title: Software engineering podcasts, I wish I had time to listen to (2017)
---

Podcasts? Is this still a thing in 2017? Personally, for me it is one of the least focus requiring means of learning and information enrichment.
Now with the video courses and tech / programming vlogs on youtube, you might definitely feel disconnected from the author a bit. For the daily commute, these podcasts still rock and I am enjoying them.

Without a further ado, here goes my list.

### 6. [Ruby Rogues](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues)

The Ruby Rogues podcast is a panel discussion about topics relating to programming, careers, community, and Ruby. They release a conversation with notable programmers and Rubyists each week to help programmers advance in their careers and skills.
Very diverse range of topics from specific, to the more generic ones. Usually ~ 1 hour, about anything from hiring to deployment and in between.

### 5. [Ruby Tapas](https://www.rubytapas.com/)

RubyTapas is for the busy Ruby or Rails developer who is ready to reach the next level of code mastery. Short, focused screencasts twice a week will introduce you to a wide variety of intermediate to advanced Ruby concepts and techniques, Object-Oriented design principles, testing practices, refactoring skills, and much more.

Now in its fourth year, with hundreds of episodes comprising more than 24 straight hours of video, RubyTapas is one of the largest collections of Ruby-related screencasts on the web. If youâ€™re hungry for advanced Ruby and software development skills, RubyTapas will satisfy your appetite. Avid had to switch to a subscription based model to sustain his work, in which I support him!

### 4. [Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast)

The father of all OSS podscasts? A first one in the list, not specifically focusing on a certain language. One with the oldest history and arguably the best name you can come up with.

### 3. [Go Time](https://changelog.com/gotime)

The youngest podcast on the list is made by Brian Ketelsen, Carlisia Pinto and Erik st. Martin. LIVE every Thursday at 3pm ET.

### 2. [Bikeshed FM](http://bikeshed.fm/)

On The Bike Shed, hosts Derek Prior, Sean Griffin, Laila Winner, and guests discuss their development experience and challenges with Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, and whatever else is drawing their attention, admiration, or ire this week.
Bikeshed feels the most hippie and relaxed one for me.

### 1. [Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/)

Here, Jeff Meyerson entertains the world with the top people in the software engineering community. Whether it's VPs of engineering or lead developers, Jeff is always superbly prepared and SED stands above all the other
mentioned podcasts on it's own. He can go over the latest ML research or jump straight to the serverless, devops, you name it. Well deserved #1!
