Welcome! I am an agile and eager full-stack developer (github: [@adamliesko](www.github.com/adamliesko)) located in [Bratislava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bratislava), who prefers backend development and enjoys Ruby/Rails the most. I am working as a Ruby on Rails developer crafting exciting biometrics solutions at [Innovatrics](http://www.innovatrics.com/), where we are doing thrilling stuff ([face verification](http://www.innovatrics.com/products/iface-sdk), [fingerprint matching](http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/ig/minexiii.cfm)  - alright this is written in C) on scale.
### More Information

Started with Ruby 1.9 and Rails 3.0.9 back in 2011 only on university and hobby projects. I instantly fell in love with the ecosystem and Ruby has been my weapon of choice since then. Along the way I have gained notable experience with other popular tools and languages like Javascript, Python, Java, SQL and NoSQL(Redis, Elasticsearch etc.). These days I am exploring Go, Scala, Apache Spark and Elixir. I am a fan of git, OS X and  Jetbrains tools, but I can adapt darn fast.

Apart from pure development I am interested in machine learning (recommender systems), search and personalization. I am an active and highly-rated (5*) mentor on [Codementor](http://codementor.io/adamliesko), [Hackhands](http://hackhands.com/adamliesko) and [Airpair](https://www.airpair.com/). As a member of team we have been pretty successfull at hackathons - we won at [SNG Hackathon](http://www.hackathon.io/hackathon-sng/projects) and got awarded 3rd place at [Aliance Fair-play Hackathon](http://hackathon.fair-play.sk/). I regularly attend [Rubyslava](http://rubyslava.sk/english.html) meetups, workshops, developer events and  conferences.

I have spent a great deal of my youth practising and competing karate at the highest level. I hold 1st dan (black-belt) and in 2012 I have won [3rd place at World University Championships](http://www.fisu.net/en/8th-World-University-Karate-Championship-in-Bratislava-Opened-3133.html?mbID=4722) in male senior kumite. Thanks to karate, I have broken few bones, ripped some ligaments (2x ACL) here and there (not necessarilly mine). Nevertheless, I have travelled around the world, made lot of friends, gained self-discipline, ability to push myself over the edge and respect others. These days I favor skiing and mountain-biking.
