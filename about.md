Welcome! I am eager Software Engineer (github: [@adamliesko](http://www.github.com/adamliesko)), located currently in the lakeside [Zurich, Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich), originally from [Slovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia). 
Preferring backend development and enjoying Ruby/Rails and Go the most.
I am developing backend platform for [Centralway Numbrs](https://www.centralway.com), disrupting the old and tedious banking world on European markets. Numbrs is #1 financial app in German App Store.
Previously, I crafted exciting biometrics solutions at [Innovatrics](http://www.innovatrics.com/), where we were doing thrilling stuff ([face verification](http://www.innovatrics.com/products/iface-sdk), [fingerprint matching](http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/ig/minexiii.cfm)) on scales of multiple millions of records, powering national elections, border controls or ID issuance processes.

### Software Engineering

Started with Ruby 1.9 and Rails 3.0.9 back in 2011. I instantly fell in love with the Rails' rich ecosystem and supportive community and Ruby has been my weapon of choice since then. 
Along the way, I have gained notable experience with other popular tools and languages like Go, Python, Javascript, Java, SQL and NoSQL(Redis, Elasticsearch etc.).

Apart from pure software development, I am interested in machine learning (recommender systems), search, personalization and distributed system. I am an active and highly-rated (5*) [Hackhands](http://hackhands.com/adamliesko), previously also at Codementor and Airpair. As a member of a team, we have been pretty successful at hackathons - in 2014 we won at [SNG Hackathon](http://www.hackathon.io/hackathon-sng/projects) and in 2015 got awarded 3rd place at [Aliance Fair-play Hackathon](http://hackathon.fair-play.sk/). I regularly attend local meetups, workshops, hackathons and conferences.

### Karate (and sport)
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/adam_karate_uni_ba.jpg)

I have spent a great deal of my youth practising and competing in WKF karate at the highest level - World Championships. I hold 1st dan (black-belt) and in 2012 I won [3rd place at World University Championships](http://www.fisu.net/en/8th-World-University-Karate-Championship-in-Bratislava-Opened-3133.html?mbID=4722) in male senior kumite category. Thanks to karate, I have had few bones broken, ripped some ligaments (2x ACL) here and there (not necessarily mine). Nevertheless, I have travelled around the world, gained self-discipline, ability to push myself over the edge and respect others. These days I favor skiing and mountain-biking.
