Welcome! I am an agile full-stack developer (github: [adamliesko](http://www.github.com/adamliesko)) located in [Bratislava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bratislava), who prefers backend development and enjoys Ruby/Rails the most. Currently I am crafting exciting biometrics solutions at [Innovatrics](http://www.innovatrics.com/), where we are doing thrilling stuff ([face verification](http://www.innovatrics.com/products/iface-sdk), [fingerprint matching](http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/ig/minexiii.cfm)) on scale.

### Software Engineering

Started with Ruby 1.9 and Rails 3.0.9 back in 2011. I instantly fell in love with the Rails' rich ecosystem and supportive community and Ruby has been my weapon of choice since then. Along the way I have gained notable experience with other popular tools and languages like Javascript, Python, Java, SQL and NoSQL(Redis, Elasticsearch etc.). These days I am exploring Go, Scala, Apache Spark and Elixir. I am a fan of git, OS X and Jetbrains tools, but I can adapt darn fast. I am fan of startups and remote work.

Apart from pure development I am interested in machine learning (recommender systems), search and personalization. I am an active and highly-rated (5*) mentor on [Codementor](http://codementor.io/adamliesko), [Hackhands](http://hackhands.com/adamliesko) and [Airpair](https://www.airpair.com/). Recently I have also started to be an active member on our saviour - [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1212336/adamliesko) As a member of team we have been pretty successfull at hackathons - in 2014 we won at [SNG Hackathon](http://www.hackathon.io/hackathon-sng/projects) and in 2015 got awarded 3rd place at [Aliance Fair-play Hackathon](http://hackathon.fair-play.sk/). I regularly attend [Rubyslava](http://rubyslava.sk/english.html) meetups, workshops, hackathons and  conferences.

### Karate (and sport)
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/adam_karate_uni_ba.jpg)

I have spent a great deal of my youth practising and competing in WKF karate at the highest level - World Championships. I hold 1st dan (black-belt) and in 2012 I have won [3rd place at World University Championships](http://www.fisu.net/en/8th-World-University-Karate-Championship-in-Bratislava-Opened-3133.html?mbID=4722) in male senior kumite. Thanks to karate, I have broken few bones, ripped some ligaments (2x ACL) here and there (not necessarilly mine). Nevertheless, I have travelled around the world, gained self-discipline, ability to push myself over the edge and respect others. These days I favor skiing and mountain-biking.
